# knowledges

This repository serves as my personal knowledge dump.

## What's Inside?

Here you'll find a collection of code snippets, architectural patterns, project prototypes, configuration files, and notes on various technologies I'm learning or working with.

The content is diverse and primarily serves as a personal reference and a place to experiment with new ideas.

## Navigation

Each directory or project within this repository (like `modular-hexagonal-architecture`) may contain its own `README.md` file with more specific details about its purpose and how to run it.
